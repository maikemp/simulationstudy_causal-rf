# Simulation study on coverage probabilities of confidence intervals for heterogeneous treatment effects estimated using causal random forests

This repository contains a Waf implementation of a simulation study on the method on "Estimation and Inference for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Using Random Forests" developed by Wager and Athey (2018). Some details on the method and the experimental setups used in this study are described in the research_paper.pdf that Waf will compile using the tex files in src/paper and the corresponding tables and graphs.

Details on the exact structure of this implementation can be found in the project_documentation.pdf that Waf compiles using the material in src/data_management and the corresponding information from the other script files. For the initial project structure and Waf configuration, I used a template from https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates.

This implementation using primarily Python and R is my final project for the course "Effective Programming Practices for Economists" and will also be used to compute results for my master thesis later on.
