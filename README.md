# Simulation study on coverage probabilities of confidence intervals for heterogeneous treatment effects estimated using causal random forests

This repository contains a Waf implementation of a simulation study on the method on "Estimation and Inference for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Using Random Forests" developed by Wager and Athey (2018). Details on the method and the experimental setups used in this study are described in the research_paper.pdf that Waf will compile using the tex files in src/paper and the corresponding tables and graphs. The main code of the simulation can be found in the subfolders of the src folder.

Details on the exact structure of this Waf implementation can be found in the project_documentation.pdf that Waf compiles using the material in src/data_management and the corresponding information from the other script files. For the initial project structure and Waf configuration, I used a template from https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates. There can also be found instructions on how to use Waf. 

This implementation using primarily R and Python is my final project for the course "Effective Programming Practices for Economists" and the structure will also be used to compute results for my Master Thesis later on.
