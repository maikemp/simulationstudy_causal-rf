******************************
Research paper / presentations
******************************


Purpose of the different files (rename them to your liking):

    * :file:`paper_ci_crf.tex` contains the actual paper.
    * :file:`presentation.tex` contains a typical conference presentation.
    * :file:`formulas` contains short files with the LaTeX formulas that are used in both before mentioned files. I also put here one table containing all the parameters of the different setups for use in the other files.
    * :file:`refs.bib` contains all references that can be cited in the other tex files.
